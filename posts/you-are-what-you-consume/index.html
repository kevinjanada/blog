The close is our friends and family; they give off an invisible peer pressure that influences our behavior. The many are the members of our group, whatever group we are in at a particular instance. When you are unsure how to act, you naturally look to others for guidance. As humans, we need to be accepted. We imitate the powerful, our heroes, and the people we look up to because they have power and status in society. People with power and status generally have more resources available, so they worry less about survival and are more attractive mates.</p><p>Therefore your habits, good or bad, are the result of the close, the many, and the powerful with whom you interact regularly. Consciously or unconsciously. So if you want to change your habits, it would be much easier if you change the people you are close to, the group you associate with, and who you look up to.</p><p>For introverts like me, inserting themselves into a new group can be hard. So what can you do? To start, you can filter out the content you consume. Think about what your goals are and what habits you are trying to build currently. Think about the heroes you look up to. Then look at the channels you subscribe to on youtube. Who do you follow on Instagram and Twitter? What books do you read? Mindfully select and consume content so that they are more aligned with your goals.</p><p>Looking back on my life, there are contents that I have consumed that really influenced my behavior and the trajectory of my life. My motivation for entrepreneurship has a lot to do with my watching the tv series Silicon Valley. I started using Vim as a code editor because I watched George Hotz programming live on Twitch. I started a note-taking habit because of Ali Abdaal, a productivity YouTuber.</p><p>I really believe that no matter how trivial the content is, it will influence your mind and, in turn, your behavior. After you repeat your behavior for a certain amount of time, eventually, it becomes your identity. So be mindful of what you consume. You are what you consume.</p></section><nav class="mt-24 flex rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] text-lg dark:bg-white/[8%]"><a class="flex w-1/2 items-center p-6 pr-3 no-underline" href=https://kevinjanada.github.io/posts/knowledge-and-action/><span class=mr-1.5>←</span><span>Knowledge and Action</span></a>
