I spend a lot of my working days feeling anxious. I have been aware of this for a long time, but I have not paid attention or thought about what causes it. There are probably many different factors, like my genes, coffee, diet, etc.

One day, while running, I was listening to a lecture by [Alan Watts](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ht2ADOFFgTVSxfJsiFZv7?si=6xndkKb-QmOFnNQM6usAeg&context=spotify%3Ashow%3A6r2JsbvfAhfGJ3dZADdiYI) titled "How to Make a Decision Without Having Anxiety." And it prompted me to ask myself. Is it decision-making that causes my anxiety?

Since most of my work is client-based projects, it always involves talking to the client about the cost estimation of a project or what solution is best for the need of a particular project. I am always anxious before a conversation because I fear saying the wrong thing, not explaining enough, or saying too much. If the client and I are not on the same page, there can be conflicts, and so projects do not go smooth. And since we get paid on a per-project basis, when the project timeline is delayed, we do not get paid on time. In turn, our staff does not get paid on time. And a delay in the timeline of one project affects the timeline of other projects as well. We currently handle about 2 - 3 projects simultaneously as a small team. I can not imagine working on tens of projects at the same time.

So my decision on what to say during a conversation would significantly impact my ability to pay my team. So that affects the livelihood of other people! No wonder I am anxious.

Perhaps I am overthinking this. There is no way someone can predict the things that will happen during a project. So maybe all you can do is take it a step at a time. Solve the problem as it comes.
