Hello people of the internet. My name is Kevin Janada, welcome to my blog.

I am a software engineer, have been for 5 years. I mostly work with web technologies, building web2 and web3 applications, specifically on the Ethereum Blockchain. I am pretty good at playing the guitar, less so on the piano, but i like playing it nonetheless. I like to learn things from books, audiobooks, podcast, videos, you name it. Anything that can help me make more sense of the world and life.    

This is my first blog post. I started this blog as an effort to achieve the many benefits of writing. The main ones i am interested in are to have more clarity in my thinking and my communication. Also to learn more effectively. Since writing down what you have learned forces you to gain a deeper understanding about concepts and ideas. You can not write about an idea in your own words, without understanding it first.  

On a less selfish motivation, i do hope that if you read my blog post, you get some value out of it.
