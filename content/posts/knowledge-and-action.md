Studying and learning are great, but if you do not put the knowledge into action, they do not mean anything. Putting your knowledge into practice also enforces them in you. You can see whether what you learn can work when you put it to use. Then you will have more confidence in your knowledge.

Since knowledge is embodied faster when you put it into practice, learning faster is to put your knowledge into practice as quickly as possible. You do not need to understand a concept by heart before putting them to use. Instead, start practicing it, and that knowledge gets reinforced as you practice. If you need to remember some things, you can always go back and review your notes.

I experience how action makes knowledge stick firsthand in my work writing software. You can understand a concept or idea faster by implementing it in software. As you implement them, you will be forced to fill the gaps in your understanding, and as you fix the errors, you are correcting any misunderstandings.

To increase the chances of putting a piece of knowledge into action, you can organize your notes by how actionable it is. PARA stands for Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archive and is a note organization system created by Thiago Forte, described in his book Building a Second Brain. Instead of placing your notes in terms of areas of study like math or physics, you put them in your currently ongoing project notes. You might put it into areas if it is unrelated to any ongoing projects. Areas are things that you commit long-term to, such as finances, health, software engineering, or skateboarding. If it doesnâ€™t fit into one of your Areas, you can put it into a Resources folder. The Resources folder contains things that interest you and might refer to in the future. When a project is completed, or you are no longer committed to an area, put them in the archive folder so that your digital notes are kept clean, but old notes can still be searchable in case you need them.

What about theoretical or abstract knowledge that may not be straightforward to practice? I think for those types of knowledge, you can start by writing an article or a blog post. Writing forces you to examine your understanding of the topic. It is easier to observe your thoughts in the form of writing where they are more concrete. You can look at your writing, see if they are coherent, and fix any mistakes. It's harder to fix mistakes or fill the holes in your misunderstanding when it is in the form of fleeting thoughts in your head.
